## Current Objective

**Task ID:** `task_03`

Build work for `task_03` is complete. Following routing guidance, Backend Dev implemented the MCP tool layer in `src/mcp_tools.py` and registry wiring in `src/tool_registry.py`; Tester added `tests/test_mcp_tools.py` coverage for the acceptance checks. Validation evidence in this build loop: `python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_tools.py -q` (7 passed) and `python -m pytest -q` (28 passed). The next explicit action is Validate for `task_03`.
