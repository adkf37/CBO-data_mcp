## Current Objective

**Task ID:** `task_06`

Validate work for `task_06` (CSV Export Capability) is complete. Independent validation in this fresh clone confirmed the enhanced `src/mcp_tools.py` export flow and CLI wiring in `main.py`: `python -m py_compile main.py src/mcp_tools.py` passed, `python -m pytest tests/test_csv_export.py tests/test_cli.py tests/test_mcp_tools.py -q` passed (11/11), `python -m pytest -q` passed (42 passed, 3 skipped), and `python -m pytest tests/ -m "not integration" --cov=src --cov-report=term` reported 78% total `src/` coverage. The only blocked scope remains live Gemini-backed execution because `GEMINI_API_KEY` is absent in the validation environment; that is already handled by the existing integration-test skip contract. The repo should now hand off to Closeout for task_06, with `task_07` and `task_08` still pending afterward.
