## Current Objective

**Task ID:** `task_06`

Build work for `task_06` (CSV Export Capability) is now implemented. `src/mcp_tools.py` replaces the task_03 export stub with full export behavior: sanitized filenames, auto-generated names containing file type/query/timestamp, metadata comment headers (`file_type`, `vintage`, `export_timestamp`), and guaranteed `./exports/` directory creation. CLI `/export` now passes task-context metadata to the tool, and new focused coverage was added in `tests/test_csv_export.py` (plus updates to existing export assertions in CLI/MCP tests). Validation-ready evidence from this build loop: `python -m pytest tests/test_csv_export.py tests/test_cli.py tests/test_mcp_tools.py -q` (11 passed) and `python -m pytest -q` (42 passed, 3 skipped). The sprint still has unfinished tasks (`task_07`, `task_08`), so the project remains in-progress and should hand off to Validate for independent verification of `task_06`.
