## Current Objective

**Task ID:** `task_04`

Build for `task_04` is complete. `src/llm_agent.py` implements `CBOAgent` with a `CBOAgent(api_key)` constructor and `ask(question) -> str` method that runs the full Gemini tool-calling loop. All MCP tools from `tool_registry.py` are registered as Gemini function declarations. The agent caps tool iterations at 10, logs each tool call at DEBUG level, and handles unknown tool names gracefully. `tests/test_llm_agent.py` adds 10 unit tests (all pass offline) and 3 benchmark integration tests (skip automatically when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is absent). Full regression: `python -m pytest -q` passes 38 tests (3 skipped). Ready for Validate phase.
