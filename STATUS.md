## Current Objective

**Task ID:** `task_02`

`src/data_loader.py` and `tests/test_data_loader.py` implemented and all 21 unit tests pass.  The `DataLoader` class reads `data/catalog.json`, consolidates multi-vintage CSVs into a single DataFrame per file type with a `vintage` column, caches in memory (≤ 500 MB) and writes `data/consolidated/<file_type>.parquet`.  Ready for Validate phase.
